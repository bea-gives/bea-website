# 🌍 Béa

*Béa* is an open source digital platform making NPO's donation effortless!

## Our Vision 👀

We believe in people and in a more balanced world!  
Let's allow the ones that can help to easily do so!

## Our Mission 👩‍🚀👨‍🚀

Create a platform that simplifies drastically donation by giving users full control about how much they give, to whom and when.

## The problem 😶

Nowadays, people are aware of the importance and involvement of Nonprofits. But knowing how to help is still an issue. 

- Charity donation remains complicated
- People want to give but don't always want to commit in the long term
- There is trust issues mainly because of lack of transparency
- It's hard to know NPOs closer to us and closer to our values
- Small NPOs don't have enough visibility

> Help us! Let's build a new solution to give to the charities that matter to us 🙌

## Our Solution 🚀✨

- **Centralization:** Centralize NPOs
- **Trust:** Each NPO is verified
- **Discovery:** Facilitate NPOs discovery from user's interests and location
- **Control:** Let users keep full control of how much they give, to whom and when (no subscriptions)
